# 🧩 Linked List Practice
This project is part of my data structures and algorithms practice.
It focuses on building a Linked List from scratch to strengthen my understanding of how data structures work behind the scenes.

# 🧠 What I Learned
- How to create and implement the Linked List data structure
- How to build Linked List methods using both recursion and iteration
- A deeper understanding of how data structures are designed, connected, and manipulated
- Improved my ability to think about memory references and algorithmic efficiency

# ⚙️ Project Overview
- A `Node` class to represent each element in the list
- A `LinkedList` class that manages nodes and provides methods such as:
- `append()`
- `prepend()`
- `size()`
- `head()`
- `tail()`
- `at(index)`
- `pop()`
- `contains(value)`
- `find(value)`
- `toString()`
- `insertAt(value, index)`
- `removeAt(index)`
